🧮 Crypto Tax Calculator - Australia 🇦🇺
Welcome to the Crypto Tax Calculator project! This web application allows users in Australia to calculate their cryptocurrency tax obligations based on the financial year's capital gains, income, and other tax-relevant inputs.

📝 Overview
This project is a free crypto tax calculator designed specifically for Australian users. The app allows users to input key financial data, including purchase price, sale price, expenses, investment type (long-term or short-term), and annual income. The application dynamically calculates capital gains and tax amounts according to Australian tax regulations.

🛠️ Functionalities
Capital Gains Calculation: Automatically calculates Capital Gains as (Sale Price - Purchase Price - Expenses).

For long-term investments, it applies a 50% discount on capital gains when applicable.
For short-term investments, it hides the discount section.
Dynamic Tax Rate: Depending on the user's annual income, the tax rate is dynamically updated.
Final Tax Calculation: The app computes the final tax amount based on the applicable tax rate and capital gains.
